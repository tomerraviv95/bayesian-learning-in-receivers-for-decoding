##  DISCLAIMERS ON INPUT SIZES
# Note that due to coding length, both the block length and pilots size have to be divisible by the message bits.
# Also, for the QPSK modulation one has to have an even number of pre-modulated bits thus
# x = block_length * (code_bits/message_bits) have to be even.
# For the same reason, in 8-PSK this quantity x has to divisible by 4.
