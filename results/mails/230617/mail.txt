Hi Nir,

A short recap before I leave to the airport:

The experimental setup
1. For four different users, I randomly generate 9,000 bits. This is the message block composed of 180 pilot bits, and the other 8820 are information ones.
2. Then for each user, I encode the data with BCH code of (63,45). The entire pilots,info parts are encoded, and we end up with a total of 12,600 bits per user.
3. Then the QPSK constellation is employed and we get 6,300 symbols per user (90 of which are pilots and the other are info).
4. Finally, the entire data of the four users is transmitted to 4 antennas at the BS, employing a static channel with taps:
[[1.         0.36787944 0.13533528 0.04978707]
 [0.36787944 1.         0.36787944 0.13533528]
 [0.13533528 0.36787944 1.         0.36787944]
 [0.04978707 0.13533528 0.36787944 1.        ]]
5. We detect the symbols with a given #method (calculating the SER) and decode with the regular  vanilla BP decoder (calculating the BER).
6. Do the above 20 times per tuple of (SNR,#method).

Results
Attached are the current results, showing both the SER (after detection, "ser_versus_snr_QPSK.png" ) and the BER (after decoding, "ber_versus_snr_QPSK.png"). The gain in SER is similar to the gains we have had in the ICC paper, around 1dB for our approach. The gain in BER is around 1.25dB. 

The gain in BER can be attributed to the following:
Gain in SER that translates into gain in BER
Better calibration of the detector's output
As we discussed, I tried to separate the two gains. To that end, I tried to plot the BER vs SER over multiple SNR values of 8,9,10 dB together and see that for the same SER, we get lower BER using calibration (tried to do so on the raw data even before the categories we discussed on in the last meeting). As can be seen in "ber_versus_ser_QPSK.png", there is indeed such a trend, but I'll try to think how to improve this curve.

My to-do list includes:
Adding the black-box Bayesian approach as a baseline
Simulating the same in 8-PSK
Thinking of some better graphs to showcase the gains due to higher calibration rather than higher SER.
How about we schedule a meeting on the 28.6/29.6 around evening time so we can discuss it before the weekend? We are meeting Osvaldo the week after so it will be important to wrap things up before the meeting.

BR & have a good week,
Tomer
